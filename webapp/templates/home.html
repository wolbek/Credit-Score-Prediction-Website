        <h3>What is credit score?</h3>
        <p>
          A credit score is a number from 300 to 850 that rates a consumer’s
          creditworthiness. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to
          potential lenders. A credit score is based on credit history: - number
          of open accounts total levels of debt repayment history, and other
          factors.

        <h3>Why you should calculate it?</h3>
        <p>
          Companies use credit scores to make decisions on whether to offer you
          a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, and other credit products, as well
          as for tenant screening and insurance. They are also used to determine
          the interest rate and credit limit you receive. Having a good credit
          score gives you leverage while applying for a loan as it assures the
          lender of your creditworthiness.

          <h3>What can damage your credit score?</h3>
          <p>
            Making a late payment, having a high debt to credit utilization ratio, applying for a lot of credit at once,  closing a credit card account or stopping your credit-related activities for an extended period can damange your credit score.
